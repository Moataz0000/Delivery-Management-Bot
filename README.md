## Project Overview

The **Delivery Management Telegram Bot** allows users to query the status of their orders by simply sending their order ID to the bot. The bot fetches the order status from a Django backend and responds with the orderâ€™s details including status, product name, and order creation date. 

### Features:
- **Order Lookup:** Users can query their orders by entering the order ID.
- **Order Status:** The bot provides real-time updates on the status of the order (Pending, In Progress, Delivered).
- **Django Backend:** The bot is connected to a Django project with an integrated database to store and manage order information.
- **Telegram Integration:** The bot is built using the `python-telegram-bot` library, making it easy to integrate with Telegram.
